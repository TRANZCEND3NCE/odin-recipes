		<h1>How to Make Strawberry Cheesecake</h1>
			<p>Strawberry cheesecake typically features a creamy, smooth filling, often made
				with cream cheese, resting on a buttery gram cracker crust. The topping often 
				includes fresh strawberries, sometimes macerated or glazed.
			</p>

			<h3>ingredients</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Crust:
					<ul>
						<li>1 1/4 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
						<li>1/3 cup butter, melted</li>
						<li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
						<li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, or to taste</li>
					</ul>
				<li>filling:
					<ul>
						<li>2 (10 ounce) packages frozen sweetened sliced strawberries, thawed and
							  drained</li>
						<li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
						<li>3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
						<li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
						<li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>
						<li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
						<li>3 large eggs</li>
						<li>1 tablespoon water (Optional)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Directions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Gather all ingredients</li>
				<li>To make the crust: Combine graham cracker crumbs, butter, sugar, and cinnamon in a
					  bowl; mix well. Press onto the bottom of an ungreased 9-inch springform pan. Place 
						in the refrigerator to chill for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F 
						(150 degrees C).
				</li>
				<li>To make the filling: Place strawberries and cornstarch into a blender; cover and puree
					  until smooth.
				</li>
				<li>Pour strawberry sauce into a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil and stir
					  until sauce is thick and shiny, about 2 minutes. Set aside 1/3 cup strawberry sauce; cool. 
						Cover and refrigerate remaining sauce for serving.
				</li>
				<li>Beat cream cheese in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; gradually
					  beat in condensed milk. Mix in lemon juice and vanilla extract, then beat in eggs on low 
						speed until just combined.
				</li>
				<li>
					  Pour 1/2 of the cream cheese mixture over crust; drop 1/2 of the reserved strawberry sauce by
					  1/2 teaspoonfuls on cream cheese layer.
				</li>
				<li>
					  Carefully spoon remaining cream cheese mixture over sauce; drop remaining strawberry sauce by
						1/2 teaspoonfuls on top.
				</li>
				<li>
					  Cut through the top layer only with a knife to swirl strawberry sauce.
				</li>
				<li>
					Bake in the preheated oven until the center is almost set, 45 to 50 minutes.
				</li>
				<li>
					  Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around the edge of the pan to loosen;
						cool for 1 hour at room temperature. Refrigerate at least 4 hours to overnight before serving.
				</li>
				<li>
					  Serve reserved strawberry sauce with cheesecake. If sauce is too thick, stir in water.
				</li>
